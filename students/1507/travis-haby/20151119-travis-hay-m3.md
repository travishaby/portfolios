# Travis Haby - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I tried to focus on workflow, using tools, and of course understanding the beast that is Rails. I feel like I really solidified my practice with git, as well as sped up my workflow by using shortcuts in Atom as well as other tools to take some of the mundane aspects of programming away. I am really excited to feel like I understand Rails pretty well. It's cool to see all kinds of error messages and know exactly what file to look in for the next step given the output of the error. Exciting!

### Attendance

I attended all days of class, arriving at school before 8:30 every day.

#### The Pivot

  * repository: 
  * group_discussion_notes: None

##### Notes:

* While the scores below seem to imply a weak project, the scores were a result of taking risks and challenging skill level. The team's skills are better as a result and this should be taken into account during portfolio reviews.
* Pushing boundries of comfort level with jQuery. Attempting things more complicated than the other projects I assessed.
* Styling could use more work.
* jQuery cart is a good start but the interface needs polish. Some prices are using dollars and others are using cents. Email sent is not complete.
* Good code quality and use of POROs

##### Scores:

* Completion: 2
* Organization: 4
* Progress: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
